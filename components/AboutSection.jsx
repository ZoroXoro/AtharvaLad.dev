      <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">
        Hello! I&apos;m Atharva Lad, a passionate Technical Artist with over 2 years of experience creating immersive gaming experiences. My journey in game development started when I was just a teenager modding my favorite games, and it has evolved into a career I truly love.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">
        I specialize in Unity development. My approach combines technical expertise with creative design to create games that are not only fun to play but also visually stunning.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg">
        When I&apos;m not coding or designing games, you can find me playing the latest indie titles, hiking in the mountains, or sketching new game character concepts.
